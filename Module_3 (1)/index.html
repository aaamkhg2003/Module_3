      Preface The goal of this book is to provide a basic understanding of the
technical design and architecture of the Internet. The book is
aimed at all audiences – even those with absolutely no prior tech-
nical experience or math skills. The Internet is an amazingly beau-
tiful design and should be understood by all who use it.
While this book is not about the Network+ or CCNA certiﬁcations,
I hope it serves as a way to give students interested in these
certiﬁcations a good starting point.
I want to thank Pamela Fox of Khan Academy for coming up with
the idea of an introductory network technology course using open
materials.
I initially developed this material as a single week’s lecture in the
SI502 - Networked Computing course that I taught at the Univer-
sity of Michigan School of Information starting in 2008. I reﬁned
and expanded the material to be three weeks of the Internet His-
tory, Technology, and Security (IHTS) course that I have taught to
over 100,000 students on Coursera starting in 2012. This book
adds further detail to create a standalone text that can be read
for enjoyment or used to support an introductory course that fo-
cuses on the Internet’s architecture.
This book has been particularly fun in that it is a collaboration with
my friends Mauro Toselli (@xlontrax) and Sue Blumenberg. I met
Mauro and Sue in 2012 when they became volunteer Community
Teaching Assistants (CTAs) for my IHTS course on Coursera. Over
the past three years we have become friends and colleagues. It
is a great example of how open education can bring people to-
gether.

Introduction
Using the Internet seems pretty easy. We go to a web address
and up comes a page. Or we go to our favorite social site and
see pictures of our friends, families, and pets. But it takes a lot
of complex software and hardware to make the Internet seem so
simple. The design of the technologies that make today’s Inter-
net work started in the 1960s, and there were over 20 years of
research into how to build internetworking technologies before
the first “Internet” was built in the late 1980s by academics in a
project called NSFNet. Since then, the research and development
into improving network technologies has continued as networks
have become far larger and faster and globally distributed with
billions of computers.
In order to better understand how today’s Internet works, we will
take a look at how humans and computers have communicated
using technology over the years.
1.1 Communicating at a Distance
Imagine a group of five people in a room sitting in a circle. As long
as they are courteous and don’t have more than one conversation
at the same time, it’s quite natural for any person to talk to any
other person in the room. They just need to be able to hear each
other and coordinate how to use the shared space in the room.
But what if we put these people in different rooms so they can
no longer see or hear each other? How could pairs of people
communicate with each other then? One way might be to run a
wire between each pair of people with a microphone on one end
and a speaker on the other end. Now everyone could still hear all
1

the conversations. They would still need to be courteous to make
sure that there was only one conversation going on at the same
time.
Each person would need four speakers (one for each of the other
people) and enough pieces of wire to connect all the microphones
and speakers. This is a problem with five people and it gets far
worse when there are hundreds or thousands of people.
Using wires, microphones, and speakers is how early telephone
systems from the 1900s allowed people to make phone calls. Be-
cause they could not have separate wires between every pair of
telephones, these systems did not allow all pairs of people to be
connected at the same time. Each person had a single connection
to a human “operator”. The operator would connect two wires to-
gether to allow a pair of people to talk, and then disconnect them
when the conversation was finished.
Figure 1.1: Connecting Using Telephone Operators
The first local telephone systems worked well when a customer’s
home or business was close to the operator’s building and a wire
could be strung directly from the operator’s building to the per-
son’s home.
1.1. COMMUNICATING AT A DISTANCE 3
But what if thousands people who are hundreds of kilometers
apart need to be able to communicate? We can’t run 100-
kilometer wires from each home to a single central office. What
the telephone companies did instead was to have many central
offices and run a few wires between the central offices, then
share connections between central offices. For long distances, a
connection might run through a number of central offices. Before
the advent of fiber optic, long-distance telephone calls were
carried between cities on poles with lots of separate wires. The
number of wires on the poles represented the number of possible
simultaneous long-distance phone calls that could use those
wires.
Figure 1.2: Long-Distance Telephone Poles
Since the cost of the wires went up as the length of the wire
increased, these longer connections between offices were quite
expensive to install and maintain, and they were scarce. So in the
early days of telephones, local calls were generally quite inexpen-
sive. But long-distance calls were more expensive and they were
charged by the minute. This made sense because each minute
you talked on a long-distance call, your use of the long-distance
wires meant no one else could use them. The telephone compa-
nies wanted you to keep your calls short so their long-distance
lines would be available for other customers.
When telephone companies started using fiber optic, more ad-
vanced techniques were used to carry many simultaneous long-
distance conversations on a single fiber. When you look at an old

photo and see lots of wires on a single pole, it generally means
they were telephone wires and not used to carry electricity.
1.2 Computers Communicate Differently
When humans talk on the phone, they make a call, talk for a
while, and then hang up. Statistically, most of the time, humans
are not talking on the phone. At least they weren’t before ev-
eryone had smartphones. But computers, including the applica-
tions on your smartphone, communicate differently than humans
do. Sometimes computers send short messages to check if an-
other computer is available. Computers sometimes send medium-
sized information like a single picture or a long email message.
And sometimes computers send a lot of information like a whole
movie or a piece of software to install that might take minutes or
even hours to download. So messages between computers can
be short, medium, or long.
In the earliest days of connecting computers to one another, pairs
of computers were connected with wires. The simplest way to
send data from one computer to another was to line up the out-
going messages in a queue and send the messages one after
another as fast as the computers and the wires could carry the
data. Each message would wait for its turn until the messages
ahead of it were sent, and then it would get its chance to be sent
across the connection.
When the computers were in the same building, the building
owner could run wires to connect them. If the computers were
in the same town, the owners of the computers generally had
to lease wires from the telephone companies to connect their
computers. They often would have the phone company connect
the wires together in their central office so that it was not
necessary for one computer to “dial” the other computer to
send data. These leased lines were convenient for computer
communications because they were “always on”, but they were
also quite expensive because they were used 24 hours a day.
When the computers were even farther away, in different cities,
the leased lines were extended using the longer wires connect-
ing the central offices. Since there were so few wires between
central offices, these long-distance leased lines were quite ex-
pensive and their cost increased dramatically as the length of the
leased line increased. But if you had enough money, you could
lease direct connections between your computers so they could
